Hi! My name is Jennifer, but most call me *Jen*. I am a Junior studying Computer Science with minors in Psychology and Web Progamming & Applications. I am a native New Yorker hailing from Queens, but have yet to explore the city to the fullest. I have a passion for computer programming and promoting diversity in the Computer Science field through CS Education. This past summer, I spent time with Girls Who Code as a Teaching Assistant and inspired [students](https://www.wherewomenwork.com/Career/2202/MetLife-Girls-Who-Code-Summer-Immersion-Program) to get excited about tech.
